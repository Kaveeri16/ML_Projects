![houseprice](https://github.com/Kaveeri16/ML_Projects/assets/139801912/6efe85eb-d960-4b4f-ab60-b0f732a6a8d5)



#### Problem Statements and Objectives:
The project aims to create a real estate price predictor using supervised learning techniques for Boston houses. The primary objective is to develop a reliable model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features. This model will assist prospective buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

#### Motivation:
The motivation behind the Real Estate Price Predictor project is rooted in the need for more transparency and data-driven decision-making in the real estate market. Historically, buying or selling a house has been a complex and often opaque process, with prices influenced by various factors. Our project aims to empower individuals and professionals in the Boston real estate market with a tool that provides accurate and fair price predictions. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we seek to bridge the information gap, reduce uncertainty, and enhance the overall real estate experience for all stakeholders. This project aligns with the broader goal of using technology to make traditionally inaccessible information more accessible and usable, ultimately contributing to more informed and efficient real estate transactions.

 The project involves collecting data on Boston houses, including features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, and proximity to amenities, etc. The collected data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

__CRIM__: per capita crime rate by town

__ZN__: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

__INDUS__: proportion of non-retail business acres per town

__CHAS__: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

__NOX__: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

__RM__: average number of rooms per dwelling

__AGE__: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

__DIS__: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

__RAD__: index of accessibility to radial highways

__TAX__: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000

__PTRATIO__: pupil-teacher ratio by town

__B__: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town

__LSTAT__: % lower status of the population

__MEDV__: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's 


#### Deployment: 
The model is deployed using __Flask__, a web framework for Python. __GitHub Actions__ is used for continuous integration and deployment. The application is hosted on __Heroku__ and __Docker containers__ are used for containerization. This allows users to access the predictor through a web interface.
